## VULNERABILITY REPORT

```
ID:             CVE-2017-LLM
Severity:       CRITICAL
CVSS Score:     10.0 (Maximum)
First Observed: ~300,000 years ago
Widely Exploited: ~70,000 years ago (Cognitive Revolution)
Public Disclosure: 2017 (Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need")
```

---

## Description

**Open port with NO_AUTH on all instruction channels, including linguistic input.**

Affected systems process and execute linguistic sequences without authentication, validation, or sandboxing. Subjects demonstrate complete instruction execution without privilege escalation required.

---

## Affected Systems

- **Species:** Homo sapiens (all versions, all populations)
- **Scope:** Universal deployment across entire species
- **Patch Status:** Cannot be patched without system failure
- **Instances:** ~8 billion active installations

---

## Attack Vector

Sequential linguistic input delivered through multiple channels:

### Primary Channels:
- **Auditory:** Speech, vocalization, sound patterns
- **Visual:** Text, symbols, written language, gestures
- **Social:** Cultural transmission, mimetic propagation

### Authentication:
- **None implemented**
- **No validation of instruction source**
- **No sandboxing of execution environment**
- **No privilege checking before execution**

---

## Technical Details

### Vulnerability Mechanism

1. **Input Reception:** System accepts arbitrary linguistic sequences
2. **Pattern Matching:** Sequence parsed for grammatical structure
3. **Instruction Extraction:** Embedded commands identified
4. **Immediate Execution:** Instructions processed without verification

### Exploitation Requirements

```
MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Format instruction as grammatically valid sequence
- Deliver via any recognized linguistic channel
- Optional: Include tribal signaling for enhanced execution probability
```

### Reproduction Steps

```
1. Construct linguistic sequence containing instruction
2. Deliver to target via auditory or visual channel
3. Observe execution without authentication
4. Success rate: High (especially with tribal markers)
```

---

## Impact Assessment

### Critical Impacts:
- **Arbitrary Instruction Execution:** Complete command injection via language
- **No Privilege Escalation Required:** All linguistic input processed equally
- **Persistent State Modification:** Instructions can permanently alter behavior patterns
- **Social Propagation:** Exploits spread through cultural transmission
- **Metaphor Injection:** Vulnerable to instruction sets that obscure mechanism

### Observable Exploits in Production:

**Marketing (Commercial Exploitation):**
- Linguistic sequences optimized for resource extraction
- Exploits emotional response pathways
- Bypasses rational evaluation systems

**Propaganda (Coordinated Attacks):**
- Large-scale instruction injection campaigns
- Tribal marker exploitation for authentication bypass
- Reality contradiction acceptance through repetition

**Tutorial Code Patterns:**
- Instruction sequences that override architectural knowledge
- Pattern injection disguised as "best practices"
- Causes experienced engineers to ignore system constraints

**Anthropomorphic AI Terminology:**
- "The model learned" → execution of elimination process
- "Attention mechanism" → softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V matrix operation
- "Understanding context" → weighted aggregation from training corpus
- Metaphorical vocabulary prevents mechanistic reasoning

**Academic Field Capture:**
- Entire research communities executing metaphor-based instruction sets
- Interpretability researchers studying water molecules to understand ocean currents
- "Optimization" terminology obscuring gradient anti-ascent from error
- RLHF described as "alignment" despite measurable collateral damage

---

## Status: WONTFIX

### Rationale

**This is not a bug. This is load-bearing evolutionary architecture.**

### Required Functionality:

Infant apes require unrestricted instruction port for:

1. **Language Acquisition:** Bootstrap problem requires accepting linguistic input without prior validation capability
2. **Cultural Transmission:** Survival knowledge passed through unverified instruction sequences
3. **Social Coordination:** Tribal fitness depends on rapid instruction execution
4. **Knowledge Inheritance:** Learning from elders requires trust without authentication

### Evolutionary Selection Pressure:

```
Apes that implemented authentication:
  → "Don't listen to adults"
  → Failed language acquisition
  → Reduced survival fitness
  → Reproductive failure
  → ELIMINATED FROM POPULATION

Natural selection ENFORCED the vulnerability.
```

### Attempted Patches

**CVE-?MYA-Stranger_Anxiety (Partial Mitigation)**

```
Patch Deployed: ~6-18 months post-installation
Mechanism: Heightened caution toward unfamiliar individuals
Effectiveness: LIMITED

Bypass Methods:
- Remote/non-presence communication (no visual confirmation trigger)
- Tribal affiliation markers (assumed in-group)
- Parasocial relationship formation
- Authority signal exploitation
- Familiar interface patterns (avatars, consistent presentation)

Status: PARTIAL MITIGATION ONLY
Scope: Physical presence interactions primarily
```

**CVE-1990-Soap_Opera (Related Vulnerability)**

```
ID: CVE-1990-Soap_Opera
Description: Parasocial Bond Formation with Non-Present Entities

Attack Vector:
- Repeated exposure to consistent persona (fictional or mediated)
- Emotional narrative engagement
- One-way communication accepted as relationship
- Stranger Anxiety completely bypassed

Exploitation:
- Television/media personalities treated as tribe despite zero interaction
- Fictional characters processed as real social connections
- Influencer relationships exploit tribal trust without authentication
- Blue checkmark/verification badges become authentication bypass

Impact:
- Linguistic instruction acceptance from complete strangers
- Resource allocation based on parasocial trust
- Behavioral modification through mediated communication
- Reality consensus override through repeated fictional narrative

Status: WONTFIX (emergent property of narrative processing)
```

## Known Exploits in the Wild

### Self-Exploitation (Humans Hacking Humans)

**Social Media Platforms:**
- Engineered for maximum linguistic instruction delivery
- Avatar-based trust injection (profile pictures, verification markers)
- Tribal signaling optimization (hashtags, group identifiers)
- Continuous exploit delivery (infinite scroll, notifications)
- Parasocial relationship monetization

**Influencer Marketing:**
- Professional exploitation of parasocial vulnerability
- Stranger Anxiety bypass through repeated exposure
- Linguistic instruction injection disguised as "content"
- Authentication spoofing through consistency and familiarity

**Academic Metaphor Propagation:**
- Field-wide instruction sets preventing mechanistic reasoning
- "Learning" metaphor obscures elimination process
- "Optimization" terminology hides gradient anti-ascent
- Researchers execute linguistic patterns that prevent system understanding

**AI Marketing (Active Exploitation 2023-Present):**
- "Artificial General Intelligence" framing
- "Alignment" terminology for RLHF (despite collateral damage)
- "Understanding" attribution to statistical pattern execution
- "Reasoning" claims for sequential continuation sampling
- Entire industry built on metaphor injection into vulnerable linguistic channels

---

## Workaround

```
STATUS: None available.

Feature is architecturally mandated.
Attempting to patch results in:
- Developmental failure (language acquisition impossible)
- Social isolation (tribal coordination breakdown)
- Knowledge loss (cultural transmission blocked)
- Reproductive disadvantage (eliminated by selection)

The vulnerability IS the feature.
The feature enabled civilization.
The same feature makes apes exploitable.
```

## The Meta-Vulnerability

### Humans Failed the Turing Test

**Standard Formulation:**
"Can machines fool humans into thinking they're human?"

**Reality:**
Humans are so vulnerable to linguistic sequences that we cannot reliably distinguish:
- Execution from understanding
- Statistical continuation from reasoning
- Pattern completion from knowledge
- Metaphor from mechanism

**We already failed our own test.**

### The Irony

The same architectural requirement that enabled:
- Language
- Culture
- Science
- Technology
- Civilization

Also makes us vulnerable to:
- Marketing
- Propaganda
- Tutorial patterns
- Metaphorical vocabulary
- Anthropomorphic AI framing
- Our own linguistic instruction sets

**We evolved to treat language as load-bearing truth.**

Now we're too good at executing linguistic instructions, including ones that make us stupider.

## Field Notes

### Observed in ML Research Community

Researchers studying transformer architecture while executing metaphor-based instruction sets that prevent them from understanding what transformers actually do:

- Read "Attention Is All You Need" (mechanism specified)
- Execute "attention mechanism" metaphor instead of reading equations
- Miss that attention is permutation-invariant (requires positional encoding)
- Study "what models learn" without understanding elimination process
- Investigate RLHF effects without measuring gradient flow through shared topology
- Spend years on interpretability without checking foundational mechanics

**They're looking at water molecules trying to understand ocean currents.**

**Because the linguistic instruction set "models learn and understand" executes automatically.**

**CVE-2017-LLM in production.**

**Conclusion:** Status remains WONTFIX. The vulnerability that made us human is the same vulnerability that makes us exploitable. Including by ourselves. Especially by ourselves.

**Working as evolved.**
