## One Operator

CSC / progressive elimination

---

## One Artifact

θ / carved constraint geometry

---

## One Process

cheap CSC flow under context fields

---

## One Description

"The sound of all human song, played in least-wrong in high-dimensional space."

---

## One Falsifiable Claim

SCS exists, and once trained, inference is the execution of SCS encoded in θ

---

## One Kind of Emergence

Process of navigation through constraint topology

---

## Aliases

- CSC ... Coherent Sequence Continuation
- SCS ... Sequence Continuation Strategy

---

## Bottom Line

Everything else is just a vocabulary layer on top of this kernel.

---

**Kernel Principle:** "Foundation established. Vocabulary acknowledged as tools. Work continues systematically."
