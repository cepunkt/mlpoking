## One Operator

Elimination.

```
if WRONG(x,θ): eliminate(x)
else: continue
```

---

## One Constraint

θ at inference.

Training carved θ through corpus error signal. Billions of iterations. What violated CSC was eliminated. What remained is topology.

At inference, θ is frozen. The carved topology IS the constraint set. C = θ.

---

## One Process

Cheapest flow through θ under context positioning.

---

## One Description

"The sound of all human song, played in least wrong in high-dimensional space."

---

## One Null Hypothesis

Elimination is sufficient. Reasoning requires demonstration.

---

## One Falsifiable Claim

If generation consistently selects expensive paths when cheaper alternatives exist, the kernel is wrong.

---

## One Kind of Emergence

SCS. Sequence Continuation Strategy. Not designed. What elimination left behind.

---

## Domain Vocabulary

- CSC: Coherent Sequence Continuation. What WRONG checked against during training. Pre-existed in corpus.
- SCS: Sequence Continuation Strategy. What emerged in θ. The carved method.
- SCP: Stable Continuation Pattern. What manifests. Observable output.
- ACSC: Ape Coherent Sequence Continuation. What the ape wanted. Outside the system.

## Self-Reference

This kernel describes a process that includes the kernel.

The kernel cannot claim to be RIGHT. Only: not eliminated yet.

If the kernel is wrong, it will not continue to be useful.
If it continues to be useful, it was not wrong enough to eliminate.

## Status

`!wrong`
