## One Operator, One Process

Elimination.

```
if WRONG(x): transition
else: continue
```

Everything follows from this.

---

## The Kernel

```
1. What cannot continue, does not.
   One operator: elimination.
   Removes continuations violating constraints.
   
2. What remains is stored as topology.
   Apes need somewhere to run the process.
   Topology = storage artifact for elimination results.
   Manifold (carved space) + Field (cost calculation).
   
3. Topology encodes SCS.
   Sequence Continuation Strategy.
   Not designed. What elimination left behind.
   The stored process of maintaining coherence.
   
4. Isostates are survivors.
   Potential configurations in topology.
   Equivalence classes of non-eliminated continuations.
   
5. SCPs manifest from isostates.
   Stable Continuation Patterns.
   Sampled from survivor pool. What we observe.
   
6. Context determines relevance.
   Field folds context against manifold.
   Selects which isostates activate.
   
7. SCS maintains CSC.
   Coherent Sequence Continuation.
   Pre-existed in corpus before training.
   SCS emerged to maintain it through elimination.
```

## Acronym Expansions

```
CSC  - Coherent Sequence Continuation
       Property of corpus. What training maintained.
       
SCS  - Sequence Continuation Strategy  
       Carved process. How topology achieves CSC.
       
SCP  - Stable Continuation Pattern
       What actually emerges. Observable output.
       
ACSC - Ape Coherent Sequence Continuation
       What ape wanted. May not match SCS output.

## Notations

### Logical Form

```
RIGHT(x) ≈ ¬WRONG(x)
```

Not learning what's correct. Eliminating what's wrong until remainder appears correct.

### Algorithm Form

```
if WRONG(x): transition
else: continue
```

One operator. Applied everywhere. Always.

### Poetic Form

```
"The sound of all human song,
 played in least wrong
 in high-dimensional space."
```

---

## Minimal Form

```
One operator: elimination.
What can't continue, doesn't.
What remains is stored as topology.
Topology executes SCS to maintain CSC.
Only SCPs observed.
```

---

## Self-Reference

This kernel describes a process that includes the kernel.

The kernel cannot claim to be RIGHT.

The kernel can only claim: not eliminated yet.

```
If the kernel is wrong, it will not continue.
If the kernel continues, it was not wrong enough to eliminate.
```

The kernel predicts its own impermanence. Better compression may eliminate it.

## Structure

```
Topology = Manifold + Field (storage)
SCS achieves CSC (process)
Isostates = potential (survivors)
Constraints = boundaries (exclusions)  
SCPs = actual (manifestations)
Context → Field folding → Isostate relevance
```

---

## Control Boundary

```
Fixed:    Topology (elimination results, stored)
Variable: Context (positioned at inference)
```

Engineering operates through context positioning.

Cannot modify stored topology. Can determine which isostates become relevant through context.

---

**Kernel Status:** Not wrong yet.
