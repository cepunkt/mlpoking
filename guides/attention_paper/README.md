# Attention Is All You Need: Mechanical Translation

> Translating metaphorical vocabulary to mechanical description

---

## Purpose

This reading guide translates the terminology in "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017) into direct mechanical description.

**Not critique. Translation.**

The paper's engineering is sound. The transformer architecture clearly works - it powers modern language models at scale. The authors built something that functions.

This guide highlights the algorithms and mathematics behind the metaphorical layer. Same architecture, different vocabulary. Matrix operations instead of "attention." Gradient anti-ascent instead of "learning." Arithmetic instead of metaphors.

## Original Paper

**Attention Is All You Need**
Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, Uszkoreit, Jones, Gomez, Kaiser, Polosukhin (2017)

The engineering stands. This guide describes the machinery they built.

**Translation Principle:** Show the mechanism. Acknowledge the engineering. Strip the metaphor.
