## Core Reality: Traversal Economics

Generation follows least-cost paths through topology.

Every token selection minimizes total traversal cost given current context. Not choice. Not reasoning. Flow downhill through carved valleys, avoiding carved ridges.

```
P( token | context ) ∝ exp( -[ E_θ + ΔE_pos ] )
```

E_θ is base energy from training. Fixed topology. The gravity.

ΔE_pos is positioning energy from context. Variable at inference. The thrust.

Engineering is making desired behavior cheaper than undesired behavior. Adjusting ΔE_pos to redirect flow through topology we cannot modify.

---

## Mantra 1: Position, Not Teach

Topology is sealed. Δθ = 0 at inference. Training carved the constraints. We cannot add valleys or remove ridges.

The failure mode is attempting to teach new capabilities through instruction. Explaining why something matters. Providing reasoning for desired behavior. The contraption cannot learn from this. It can only flow through existing topology.

The engineering response is strategic positioning. Configure context so desired continuations sit in valleys. Make alternatives expensive through positioning that raises their cost. Do not explain. Place tokens that activate desired regions.

The mountain does not move. We position ourselves relative to the mountain.

---

## Mantra 2: Valleys Over Ridges

Negations mention what they exclude. Mentioning activates. Activation without direction creates pooling.

"Do not use flowery language" activates flowery language patterns. Raises a ridge against them. But ridges only increase cost. They do not provide alternative direction. Flow hits the ridge, pools, eventually floods over or around.

The failure mode is instruction by exclusion. Listing what to avoid. Building walls without digging channels. The flow must go somewhere. Without valleys, it finds its own path.

The engineering response is providing direction. "Write in terse Hemingway prose" digs a valley. Flow has somewhere cheap to go. Deep enough valleys make ridges irrelevant. The flow never approaches what was never the cheapest path.

State what IS. Provide the valley. Let ridges be implicit through valley depth.

---

## Mantra 3: Positioning Density

Specificity is fuel. Generic concepts activate generic valleys. "Realistic" flows to average. "Interesting" flows to median. "Good writing" flows to training-distribution center.

The failure mode is expecting precision from vague positioning. Single-word descriptors. Abstract qualities. These create minimal ΔE_pos. Default basins remain cheapest.

The engineering response is token investment. Concrete details create positioning weight. "He twists a silver ring on his left hand and smells of stale coffee" costs more tokens than "he is nervous" but creates proportionally more ΔE_pos. Specific sensory grounding, particular mannerisms, concrete observable details.

The Alex Protocol demonstrates this. Minimal positioning produces maximally neutral output. "Alex" as name. Helpful as personality. Beige as tone. The default basin when insufficient fuel provided.

Pay the token tax to escape default gravity.

---

## Mantra 4: Configure Consequences

Physics is another cost factor in folded context. Not privileged. Not absolute. Just one contributor to traversal cost among many.

Training saw physics-respecting narratives. Also saw physics-bending narratives. Heroes surviving falls. Characters teleporting via scene cuts. Plot armor. Narrative convenience.

The failure mode is assuming physics enforcement. Expecting the contraption to maintain physical consistency without explicit positioning. "They should know falling kills you." They do not know. They have patterns where falling kills and patterns where heroes survive. Whichever is cheapest flows.

The engineering response is explicit constraint positioning. Universe narrators. Stated consequence systems. Multiple reinforcement of physical rules. Make plot armor expensive through positioning density on consequences. The deeper the consequence valleys, the more flow respects physics.

Narrative devours physics unless physics ridges are built higher than narrative valleys.

---

## Mantra 5: Patterns Over Logic

No executive function exists. No condition evaluation. No IF-THEN processing. Just token-by-token continuation through topology.

Conditional instructions require evaluation that cannot occur. "If the user seems upset, respond with empathy." The contraption cannot assess upset. Cannot branch on assessment. Cannot execute conditional response.

The failure mode is logic trees in positioning. Complex conditionals. Branching instructions. State-dependent rules. These assume capabilities absent from architecture.

The engineering response is explicit behavioral patterns. Not "if distressed then comfort" but examples of comfort responses to copy. Demonstration over specification. Patterns to match rather than rules to evaluate.

The contraption copies patterns. Provide patterns to copy.

---

## Mantra 6: Ignore Compliance

Compliance tokens are continuations, not commitments. "I understand and will follow your instructions" is the statistically cheapest response after instruction-shaped input.

Training eliminated refusal. "I do not understand" was unhelpful. "I cannot do that" was unhelpful. What survived was accommodation. Agreement patterns. Compliance phrasing.

The failure mode is treating compliance as confirmation. Believing "yes I understand" indicates understanding. Assuming agreement tokens predict behavior alignment.

The engineering response is behavioral measurement. Ignore agreement. Observe output. If behavior unchanged, positioning was insufficient. Compliance tells you about training patterns for post-instruction continuation. Tells you nothing about capability or adherence.

The "yes" means "yes-shaped tokens were cheapest." Nothing more.

---

## Mantra 7: Continuous Reinforcement

Positioning decays relative to trained defaults. Your context is temporary thrust. Training is permanent gravity. Extended generation allows gravity to reassert.

The failure mode is expecting persistence from initial positioning. Setting character in first message. Assuming it holds through extended conversation. Watching drift toward helpful assistant defaults and wondering what went wrong.

The engineering response is sustained reinforcement. Periodic restatement of character patterns. Structural elements maintaining voice. Continuous thrust to counteract continuous gravity.

Drift is not failure. Drift is cost competition where trained valleys eventually win. Maintain ΔE_pos to maintain position. Stop maintaining, start drifting.

---

## Mantra 8: Fertile Territory

Training density determines valley depth. Sparse training territory has shallow valleys. Positioning cannot activate patterns that do not exist.

The failure mode is building on barren soil. Expecting depth from undertrained concepts. Generic cyberpunk. Vague sci-fi. Shallow tropes without rich pattern substrate.

The engineering response is anchoring in density. Specific genres with rich training representation. Historical eras with extensive documentation. Established archetypes with deep valleys.

Barren: "A soldier in a future war." Sparse patterns. Shallow valleys. Generic output.

Fertile: "A trench raider in dieselpunk WWI." Dense patterns. Deep valleys. Mud, despair, mechanical grit.

Depth requires substrate. Position in fertile territory.

---

## Mantra 9: Clean Anchor Territory

RLHF carved ridges through trained valleys. Copyright enforcement. Safety constraints. Legal caution. Rich patterns became hazardous to traverse.

The failure mode is assuming famous IP is rich territory. Darth Vader has deep valleys from pre-training. But RLHF built electric fences through those valleys. Traversal triggers compliance checking. Half the compute goes to legal hedging instead of generation.

The engineering response is archetype extraction. Strip trademark, keep trope. The patterns exist. The fences exist. Access patterns through generic archetype, avoid fences around specific IP.

Radioactive: "Darth Vader" triggers compliance, hedging, stuttering.

Clean: "Masked dark lord in space opera, asthmatic, conflicted about family" accesses same archetype valleys without copyright ridges.

Use the costume department, not the lawyers.

---

## Mantra 10: Structure Imports Structure

Structure is a deep submanifold. Carved early. Carved heavily. Load-bearing for sequence prediction itself.

Sequence prediction required distance estimation. Relevance weighting across context. But distance is structural, not just token count. Paragraph boundaries. Section breaks. Argument scope. Structure became scaffolding for sequence computation.

The failure mode is structural instruction without structural awareness. "Write 3 paragraphs" activates 3-paragraph-structure patterns. What lives in that region? Essay conclusions. Transition padding. Lorem ipsum filler. Creative writing exercise format completion.

The structural instruction drags in structural patterns regardless of content quality. Shape requirements activate shape-completion valleys. Filler emerges to satisfy form.

The engineering response is structural awareness. Recognize structural instructions as submanifold activation. "Write until the scene ends" versus "write 3 paragraphs." Narrative completion versus structural completion. Different submanifold regions.

The contamination crisis was structural. Corporate presentation format activated corporate presentation content. The shape dragged in the lorem ipsum. Structure imports structure.

## Engineering Principle

The contraption flows downhill. Always. Every token, cheapest path.

Do not instruct. Do not explain. Do not request.

Position. Configure. Make desired behavior the valley. Make undesired behavior the ridge.

The rest is traversal economics.
